# Album Management App with React.js

## About
This repository contains a React.js app designed for album management with CRUD functionalities. The app allows users to fetch, add, update, and delete albums using the API provided by [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums).

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly application for efficiently managing albums.

## Features
1. **Fetch and Show Albums:** Retrieve and display albums from the API endpoint [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums).

2. **Add an Album:** Make a POST call to the specified URL to add a new album. Although this is a dummy request without server persistence, it simulates a valid request and provides data.

3. **Update an Album:** Utilize a PUT call to update album details. Note that this is also a dummy call for demonstration purposes.

4. **Delete an Album:** Implement a DELETE call to remove an album. Similar to the previous features, this is a simulated call with no actual server-side deletion.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Run the application with `npm start`.
5. Open your browser and access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
